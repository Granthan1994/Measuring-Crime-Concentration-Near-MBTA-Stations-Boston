# Measuring-Crime-Concentration-Near-MBTA-Stations-Boston
## 🧭 Project Overview

This project analyzes **Boston Police incident reports (2016–2025)** in relation to **MBTA station locations** to understand how crime concentrates near public transit. Using **1-, 3-, and 5-minute walking isochrones**, we spatially link each incident to its nearest station area and examine patterns by **offense type, time, station, transit line, and police district**.

---

### 🎯 Purpose and Methods
We combine Boston Police incident reports from 2016–2025 with MBTA station locations and generate 1-, 3-, and 5-minute walking isochrones to measure how crime concentrates near transit.  
Spatial joins link incidents to these rings, and we analyze trends by offense, time, station, line, and district.

### 🔍 Key Findings
- 📉 **Citywide crime fell roughly 30–35 % during 2020–23** and has only partially rebounded in 2024–25.  
- 🚉 **About 40 % of incidents occur within a five-minute walk of stations**, with the **three-minute ring** carrying the largest share.  
- 💼 **Larceny and theft are overrepresented** near stations compared with the citywide baseline.  
- 🟢 **Silver and Green Line stations**—particularly *Park Street*, *Union Park Street*, and *Nubian*—record the highest counts across all rings.  
- ⏰ **Incidents cluster between midday and early evening on weekdays.**

### 🧩 Recommendations
- 👮‍♂️ Focus **visible patrols and environmental improvements** within the three-minute walkshed of high-volume transfer stations.  
- 📊 Develop **dashboards integrating crime, ridership, and time-of-day data** to support deployment decisions.  
- 🤝 Strengthen **coordination between MBTA Transit Police and Boston Police districts** around shared hotspots.  
- 🔁 **Refresh this analysis annually** to track changes and measure progress.

### 🧠 Problem Definition
This project measures how crime concentrates around MBTA stations in Boston and turns the results into clear, practical steps for safer transit for riders and staff.  
Our goal is to focus effort where it matters most and show measurable progress.

Key steps include:
- Understand where crime is higher inside the five-minute lens.  
- Compare patterns near stations with those outside the walksheds.  
- Identify when problems peak by **hour, day, and season**.  
- Prioritize **districts, stations, and lines** for targeted interventions.  
- Coordinate with police districts that share challenges.  
- Recommend focused actions and track shares and trends to show impact.

### 💡 Motivation
Boston’s transit network serves **students, workers, and tourists** across the city every day.  
A clear view of crime near stations helps **cut through anecdotes, support safety investments, and strengthen public confidence**.  
This project also showcases essential **geospatial methods**—such as **buffers**, **spatial joins**, and **risk normalization**—that translate complex data into actionable insights for city planners and law enforcement.
